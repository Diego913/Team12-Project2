#Time Accounting
How we arrived to the time estimates of each of us working on the project
	-An Excel sheet on google documents was created where each team 
	member would clock in and out when the project was worked on
	-This caused for a detailed and accurate documentation of how many 
	hours were spent on the project
	-Everyone did their part with writing down their hours and as a team
	we collectively made it of high importance to have meetings to 
	discuss what was happening in the project, what needed to get done, 
	and any questions or confusion we may have had. 
	-As a team many people were on the git branches on the same time 
	and we saw eachother work as the days went by. 
	-Everyones hours reflect the amount of work that was put in to the 
	project.
