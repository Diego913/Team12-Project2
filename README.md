# BATTLESHIP 
EECS 448 - Project 1
Team 02

## Intro
This project was implemented for the purpose of EECS 448 project 1 at The University of Kansas. It is a 
multiplayer game with a 10x10 grid. There are six different ships to choose from of different lengths. 
As players take turns, the user picks a square and then they are informed if the ship was hit or missed.
A player wins when all the ships are sunk. 

## Running the program
The program is run by opening up the HTML file, it should show up on a web browser and the game will
start. The coding implementation was made with HTML, JAVA, JS and CSS. 

## Structure
The program has a Board.js, Game.js, index.html, and Ship.js files where each file has its own function. 
The Board.js file constructs the board the cells within the board to see if the board has been hit or missed. 
The Game.js file controls the logic of thr game. Where it has the number of players, creates the two boards, 
runs the game, and checks when the game is over. The index.html file keeps everything intertwined for function 
use. The Ship.js file holds the functions for ship usage.
